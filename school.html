          <p style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">Bahria Town School Lahore started as a single campus in Sector B, with a few students. Over the past 16 years, the school has grown into a multi-campus school system with seven campuses in two cities and a student body comprising of 6800+ students. The growth in the number of students over the past few years has been phenomenal.
